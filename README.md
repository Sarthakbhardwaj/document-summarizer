# Document-Summarizer

About: 

Today, cnline content increases at an alarming rate which exceeds users' ability to consume such content. Users may have to creat summaries of all the text manually which is cumbersome, hence there is a great need for an automatic summarizer

Our Model:

we have followed a research paper (https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/I17-1081.pdf) 
so our model applies a four stage approach to create a summary concept map:
  1. Concept and relation extraction 
  2. FIltering 
  3. Concept graph construction 
  4. Graph summarization
